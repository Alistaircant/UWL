#question 4: Write code to calculate the average of: {3, 11, 78, 112, 4, 18} in one single line of code. 

print((3 + 11 + 78 + 112 + 4 + 18)/6)



#question 5: Write a program that asks the user for an integer number and then prints out the remainder after the number is divided by 7.

num1 = int(input('type a number: '))
print(num1 % 7)



#question 6: Expand the above program (5.) by also printing out how often the number 7 “fits” into the number the user entered. 

num1 = int(input('type a number: ')) 
print(num1 % 7) 
print(num1//7)
