## question 2) statement written to test if user entered "y". 

userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.")
if  userInput == "y":
    print("Goodbye")

## question 3) correct errors in the following statements:

#a)
x = 1 #correction
if x > 0 then :
    	print(x)
      
#Answer: the word ‘then’ is not a function. The programmer also hasn’t defined x.

#b)
from math import sqrt #correction
x = 1 #correction
if 1 + x > x ** sqrt(2) :
     	y = y + x

#Answer : the programmer hasn’t imported the sqrt function from math.  The programmer also hasn’t defined y or x

#c) 
if x = 1 :
  y += 1
#Answer: the programmer hasn’t defined x or y. They are also missing another equals sign at the IF function. It should be a double equals function

#d) 

grade = int(input("type the grade percentage: ")) #correction
letterGrade = "F"
    if grade >= 90 :
	letterGrade = "A"
    if grade >= 80 :
	letterGrade = "B"
    if grade >= 70 :
	letterGrade = "C"
    if grade >= 60 :
	letterGrade = "D"

#Answer: grade is not defined. The programmer needs to write a line that assigns a value to ‘grade’.

# 4) create a program that breaks down a flow chart to display the impact that an Earthquake would have depending on the users chosen magnitude value.

richter = float(input("Enter a magnitude from the richter scale: "))

if richter >= 8.0:
    print('Most buildings will have been destroyed.')
elif richter >= 7.0:
    print('Many buildings will have been destroyed.')
elif richter >= 6.0:
    print('Many buildings will be heavily damaged. Some will fall.')
elif richter >= 4.5:
    print('Damage to poorly constructed buildings.')

else:
    print('no destruction of buildings')
    
##question 5) creating a password with limited attempts

#Variables:
remainingAttempts = 4
attemptNum = 0
correctPassword = 1
guess = input('Enter the password: ')

#incorrect password result, attempt number counter and remaining attempts count down:
while guess != 'changeme':
    print('wrong password. You have',remainingAttempts,'more attempts.')
    guess = input('Try again: ')
    remainingAttempts = remainingAttempts - 1
    attemptNum = attemptNum + 1

    #extra challenge
    if remainingAttempts == 0:
        input('Entry denied. Please press enter to exit and contact security to reset password.')
        exit()
#correct password result
if guess == 'changeme':
    print('Accepted! That only took you',attemptNum,'attempts!')
    


##Question 7) write a program which generates a table which displays the powers of the first five numbers.

#Here the code asks for the users input to choose the numbers which are to be squared or cubed.
print('Choose 5 numbers you would like to square and cube')
number1 = int(input('First number: '))
number2 = int(input('Second number: '))
number3 = int(input('Third number: '))
number4 = int(input('Fourth number: '))
number5 = int(input('Fifth number: '))

#Here the code displays the results in a table.

print(' 1   2   3   ')
print(' x   x   x   ')
print('-------------')
print('',number1**1,' ',number1**2,' ',number1**3,' ')
print('',number2**1,' ',number2**2,' ',number2**3,' ')
print('',number3**1,' ',number3**2,' ',number3**3,' ')
print('',number4**1,' ',number4**2,' ',number4**3,' ')
print('',number5**1,' ',number5**2,' ',number5**3,' ')
