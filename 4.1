# The program I was asked to write for session 4 (question 8):

name = input('what is your name? ')
age = int(input('how old are you? '))

print('hello ',name,'next year you will be ',(age + 1),'years old!')

# Here is another piece of code from session 4 (question 9):

print("\tRadius is:","\t 2")
print("\tArea is:","\t 12.57")

#This next code I wrote to work out some mathematic problems on question 10:

p = 17
q = 18
print(p // 10 + p % 10)
print(p % 2  + q % 2)
print((p + q) // 2)
print((p + q) / 2.0)
